	<p>
	My name is Sean Murphy. I am from West Des Moines, Iowa and have previously lived in Florida, California, and Maryland.
	Currently, I live in Coralville, Iowa were I am attending the University of Iowa studying Business Analytics and Information Systems
	at the Tippie College of Business. After high school I served in the U.S. Navy from 2011 - 2018 as an <a href="https://www.navy.com/careers/information-systems-technician" target="new">Information Systems Technician</a>
	where I worked as a Systems Administrator and Radio Technician. During this time I gained valuable first hand experience working with a 
	wide range of applications and programs including Microsoft Server, Linux, Oracle DB, and more. The most rewarding aspect of serving in the Navy 
	was working along side highly talented individuals from all walks of life to accomplish a common goal as well as being able to travel the world 
	in the process.
	<br />
	In May 2022 I will be graduating from the Tippie College of Business and moving to the Minneapolis - Saint Paul area were I seek to bring my 
	experience and skills to an exciting career. I believe in being a lifelong learner and am looking forward to expanding my skillset in addition 
	to professional development. A fun fact about me is that I love animals as you can see in my picture at a local animal sanctuary!
